To harness the enhanced computing capabilities of a GPU, individuals should install the appropriate GPU drivers. These drivers facilitate seamless communication between the operating system and the GPU hardware, resulting in optimal performance for tasks like machine learning and graphics-intensive applications. 

The generall steps below outline the process:

## * Identify the GPU
 Us*ers should determine the make and model of the GPU (e.g., NVIDIA or AMD) as well as the specific version.
## * Download Drivers: 
They should visit the official website of the GPU manufacturer (NVIDIA or AMD) and locate the drivers section. The next step is to download the latest GPU drivers compatible with the GPU model and operating system version.
## * Installation:
On Linux (Ubuntu or other distributions):
For NVIDIA GPUs: Following the provided instructions, users should install the drivers. This typically involves executing commands in the terminal and rebooting the system.
For AMD GPUs: The installation of drivers should occur using package managers or scripts provided by the manufacturer.
## * Verification:
Post-installation, users should conduct a verification process to ascertain the correct functionality of the GPU drivers. This can be achieved by inspecting system information or employing GPU-related commands. This step serves to confirm whether the system accurately recognizes and effectively utilizes the GPU.

It's imperative to note that the installation procedure can differ based on the brand, model, and specific Linux distribution of the GPU. Users are strongly advised to refer to the official documentation offered by NVIDIA, AMD, or their chosen distribution for precise and updated installation instructions. The installation of GPU drivers stands as a pivotal component in harnessing maximum GPU capabilities, thereby elevating performance across a gamut of computational tasks.

In our project, our objective is to simplify the process by facilitating the script, as there are indeed multiple approaches available. We have identified a code crafted by Google engineers, which is accessible on the Google Cloud page: [Install GPU drivers](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/install-drivers-gpu)
