## What is CUDA?

![CUDA](https://oerc.ox.ac.uk/media/12659/nvidia-cuda.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=950&height=460&rnd=133263876560000000)

CUDA, which stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture, is a parallel computing platform and Application Programming Interface (API) developed by NVIDIA. CUDA enables developers to harness the immense computational power of NVIDIA GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) for a wide range of general-purpose computing tasks, including deep learning, scientific simulations, image processing, and more.

## Why do we need to use CUDA?

By installing CUDA, we enable our software to communicate directly with the GPU, offloading complex calculations and data manipulations to the highly parallel architecture of the GPU cores. This results in significantly faster execution times for our computations, ultimately accelerating our project's progress.

CUDA is not only crucial for our project's performance but also for compatibility with various libraries and frameworks optimized for GPU acceleration. Many popular libraries used for machine learning, scientific computing, and data analysis, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and cuDNN, are built to work seamlessly with CUDA, enhancing their performance when executed on GPUs.
